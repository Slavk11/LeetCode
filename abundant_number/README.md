# ðŸ’¡ Abundant Number

## ðŸ“˜ Challenge â€” *Easy*

Write a function that takes a positive integer and checks whether it is an **abundant number**.

An **abundant number** is a positive integer for which the **sum of its proper divisors** (excluding the number itself) is **greater than the number**.  
In other words, the number is *abundant* in terms of its divisors.

## ðŸ§  What are Proper Divisors?

Proper divisors of a number are all its positive divisors **excluding the number itself**.

## âœ… Examples

- **12**  
  Divisors: `1, 2, 3, 4, 6`  
  Sum: `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16`  
  â†’ `16 > 12` â†’ **Abundant**

- **18**  
  Divisors: `1, 2, 3, 6, 9`  
  Sum: `1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 9 = 21`  
  â†’ `21 > 18` â†’ **Abundant**

- **10**  
  Divisors: `1, 2, 5`  
  Sum: `8`  
  â†’ `8 < 10` â†’ Not Abundant
